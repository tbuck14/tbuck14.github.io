      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like
        coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing
        keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just
        reboot the darn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
        benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
        movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/#email_list">sign up for our

      <p>My maternal grandmother, Willie Lee Lipscomb, was a poet. She wrote no books—she was not an academic; she worked with her hands and her body and made a way as a single parent to my mother and my aunts. I mean that she was a poet in the way she lived her life, in the inimitable balm of her laugh, in the way her words have lived on. My mother told me that she advised her children in this way: “Don’t start what you can’t hold out.” I think about all the things my grandmother held out, and, following her example, what my mother has held out: families reared and kept together, God poured through all of us, an appreciation for the value of a story well told. In our family, we do what we do in love and with Spirit guiding us.
     This makes me think about how much it means to commit, what it means to say a thing and do it. I have committed to the action of poetry—I am, therefore I write. For me, being a poet, and by extension, an editor, is a position of great responsibility to the communities I serve. I’m trusted with the words that I write and that I share, and those words have to do work on the page and in the world. Those words have to be life-giving. And then I think of what Harriet Monroe described in early letters from her editorial desk—an open door, a place for poetry to be celebrated, to address life in all its facets.
     What I want to commit to, in my tenure as guest editor, is my desire to open the door, yes, but also to open the windows so the fresh air comes in, to paint the walls a color which makes way for more color, to put a soft and easy chair in the reading corner and a plant to make things clean. I want Poetry magazine to represent the people who make poetry, who read poetry, who stumble upon it or study it, and who recite it on stages or speak it in languages not called English. I want to commit to the vibrant landscape of poem-loving humans. I want the poems to make folks shout—hallelujah poems.
     The poems collected here are deliberate in their breath. They speak authentically, they play with form and without form. They each start conversations that will, I hope, continue in rooms, journals, class discussions, kitchens, living rooms, books to come. These poems demonstrate my goal to simply hold the door open for folks to come in, regardless of their proximity to academia, regardless of their region of origin, age, race, gender identity, sexuality, or the style in which they write. These poems are on page and on video. Poems set across the world. This issue is not a special issue—rather, it is an issue which seeks to act as service, and as representative of my desire to make our literary roads wider and unreachable by supremacist or patriarchal vehicles.</p>

    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a
      billion people, and probably more.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://learnenough.com/"> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
            introductory sequence.
          </p>

            Michael is also notorious as the founder of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
            Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are
            slightly exaggerated.

            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
            Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true
            nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
            from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
